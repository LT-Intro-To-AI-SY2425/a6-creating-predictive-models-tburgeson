# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r^2 is 0.626, which means the algorithm is able to predict the y-variable correctly around 63 percent of the time. The r^2 value is how well a linear regression model fits a dataset.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
136.5

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think it's somewhat accurate, but more data points are needed from multiple diverse sources to make sure that the data is as accurate as possible.
