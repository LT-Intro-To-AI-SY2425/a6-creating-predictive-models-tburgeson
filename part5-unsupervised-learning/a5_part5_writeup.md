# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

Top left: stupid (spend much more than they make)
Bottom left: fiscally responsible (spend within their constrained limits)
Middle: children (don't spend anything, don't make anything)
Bottom right: penny pinchers (can spend more but choose not to)
Top right: manic consumer (make the same amount they spend)

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
They would be in the bottom right group, "penny pinchers"

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
I think marketers approach the left side of the graph by making a uniquely addictive product, and try to bring as many people as possible from each quadrant into the top left group. The cigarette and alcohol industry is pretty good at this.
